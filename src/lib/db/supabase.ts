/**
 * Server-side Supabase admin client (singleton).
 *
 * SERVER-ONLY. Uses the SERVICE ROLE key, which bypasses every Row Level
 * Security policy and has unrestricted read/write to the entire database.
 * It must NEVER reach the browser bundle:
 *  - it is not prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_
 *  - it is only ever imported from server code (route handlers, server
 *    actions, server components) — never from `'use client'` files
 *  - a runtime guard below throws if this module is somehow evaluated in a
 *    browser context (defence in depth)
 *
 * Singleton rationale: `createClient` is cheap but Next.js can re-evaluate
 * modules per request in dev/HMR. Memoising on `globalThis` keeps a single
 * client across hot reloads and avoids leaking connections/listeners.
 *
 * Future scalability:
 *  - When DB tables land, generate types with `supabase gen types typescript`
 *    and parameterise `createClient<Database>` for end-to-end type safety.
 *  - A separate request-scoped anon/SSR client (cookie-aware) can be added
 *    alongside this admin client without changing call sites.

/**
 * ── Node.js 20 WebSocket compatibility ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `createClient` always constructs an internal RealtimeClient, EVEN IF we
 * never open a channel — realtime is initialised eagerly as part of the
 * client, not lazily on first subscribe. That RealtimeClient resolves a
 * WebSocket constructor at init time.
 *
 * The browser and Node.js 22+ expose a GLOBAL `WebSocket`. Node.js 20 does
 * NOT — there is no `globalThis.WebSocket` — so supabase-realtime throws
 * "Node.js 20 detected without native WebSocket support" the moment the
 * client (and therefore the seed script / any server route) initialises.
 *
 * Fix: inject the `ws` package as the realtime transport. `ws` is a pure
 * Node module and is only reachable here, which is SERVER-ONLY (guarded
 * below + service-role key + never imported by client/edge code), so it
 * never reaches the browser bundle or the Edge middleware. The browser keeps
 * using its native global WebSocket; this override only matters in Node.
 *
 * `ws`'s WebSocket is API-compatible with Supabase's minimal
 * `WebSocketLikeConstructor` but its TS types are not structurally identical
 * (different event/`send` typings), so we bridge with a single explicit cast
 * here rather than leaking `any` into the codebase.
