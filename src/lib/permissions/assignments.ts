 *
 * PLUS in every row: `actorId === targetUserId` → ALWAYS false
 * (no user can assign a lead to themselves).
 *
 * ── Phase 2L: admins are non-operational ───────────────────────────────────
 *  Admins are PLATFORM OPERATORS — they configure users, branches, and
 *  workflow rules; they don't receive operational leads. Letting an admin
 *  hold lead ownership would:
 *   1. Hide the lead from sales-pipeline metrics (analytics rows aggregated
 *      by sales tier would silently drop admin-owned leads).
 *   2. Create a workflow back-channel: a manager could "park" a difficult
 *      lead on an admin to escape responsibility / audit pressure.
 *   3. Confuse SLA / first-response tracking, since admins are not on the
 *      sales-floor rotation.
 *  Easier to ban admins as targets than to special-case every downstream
 *  consumer.
 *
 * ── Self-assignment is forbidden ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *  An assignment routes work between users. Routing to yourself is a no-op
 *  in the operational model AND a known abuse vector:
 *   - A manager grabbing a hot lead by self-assigning bypasses fair
 *     distribution.
 *   - A self-assign + immediate status-change ("converted") would let an
 *     actor manufacture personal pipeline credit without an upstream
 *     handoff in the audit log.
 *  Note: the role-routing matrix above already incidentally blocks every
 *  same-role self-assign (admin→admin, manager→manager, SSE→SSE are all
 *  ✗). The id check is the explicit guard that survives any future relax
 *  of the role matrix.
 *
 * ── Phase 2I: SSE team-lead layer (unchanged) ──────────────────────────────
 *  Senior Sales Executive remains a "lightweight team lead" within their
 *  branch — can route work DOWN to Sales Executives only.
 *
 * Pure 4-argument predicate — composes cleanly with `requireMinimumRoleApi`,
 * which already proves the actor's role is what they claim via a verified
 * JWT + Node-side DB re-read.

 *  Admins are platform operators, not pipeline owners. Routing a lead to an

 *  than special-casing every downstream consumer.

 *  An assignment routes work between users. Self-routing is a no-op in the

 *
 * ── Why role-hierarchy is the gate ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *  Only one rule: actor must outrank target. SSE → manager would invert the
 *  org chart; manager → manager would let peers shuffle work without admin
 *  oversight. SE cannot assign at all.

/**
 * Is `assignee` a VALID OWNER for a lead in `leadBranch`?
 *
 * Rule (Phase 2K):
 *   - empty allowed_branches → unrestricted, always valid
 *   - non-empty           → branch MUST appear on the list
 *
 * ── Why this rule applies regardless of who is assigning ────────────────────
 *  This predicate is about the (lead, assignee) pair, NOT about the actor.
 *  Even an admin actor must not be allowed to assign a "Sec 83" lead to a
 *  user who doesn't have "Sec 83" in their scope: the assignee's own
 *  `canViewLeadData` would then deny them visibility on the lead they
 *  supposedly own. The result is a GHOST ASSIGNMENT — visible to admins /
 *  managers in the assignments page, invisible to the actual owner. That's
 *  a worst-case RBAC failure mode: it looks correct in admin views and
 *  silently strands work.
 *
 * ── Why this is distinct from `canAccessLeadBranch` ────────────────────────
 *  `canAccessLeadBranch(user, branch)` returns true for ANY admin — it
 *  answers "can this user read/manage data in this branch?". Admins are
 *  always allowed to do that.
 *
 *  `canAssignLeadToBranch(assignee, branch)` does NOT special-case admin —
 *  it answers "is this user a legitimate OWNER for work in this branch?".
 *  An admin with empty allowed_branches passes (they're unrestricted); an
 *  admin with restricted branches would only pass for those branches,
 *  matching the rule the spec calls for.
 *
 * ── Why dropdown filtering alone is insufficient ───────────────────────────
 *  The inline picker excludes invalid users from the dropdown for UX, but a
 *  crafted POST/PATCH from DevTools or curl bypasses the UI entirely. The
 *  authoritative gate is this predicate, applied inside the assignment
 *  API handlers, after the role-routing matrix.
