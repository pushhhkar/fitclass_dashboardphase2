/**
 * Password hashing & verification.
 *
 * SERVER-ONLY. Never call these from client code — raw passwords must never
 * leave the server boundary, and the hashing cost would block the UI thread.
 *
 * Why hashing (and never plaintext):
 *  - A database leak must not expose usable credentials. Storing plaintext (or
 *    reversible encryption) means one breach compromises every account and,
 *    given password reuse, accounts on other systems too.
 *  - bcrypt is a deliberately *slow*, salted, adaptive hash. The per-hash salt
 *    defeats rainbow tables; the tunable cost factor lets us scale difficulty
 *    as hardware gets faster.
 *
 * Cost factor (salt rounds): 12 is the current sensible default — strong
 * against offline brute force while keeping server login latency acceptable
 * (~tens of ms). Bump it over time as CPUs get faster; existing hashes remain
 * verifiable because the cost is encoded in the hash string itself.
