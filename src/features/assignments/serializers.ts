/**
 * DB row → app-facing assignment view. Pure projection.

 * Phase 2U: the view now carries denormalised assignee identity
 * (`assignee_name`, `assignee_email`) so the UI never has to fall back to
 * displaying the raw `assigned_to` UUID when the assignee isn't in the
 * caller's candidate list. The denormalised fields come from a single
 * PostgREST `users` embed at query time — see queries.ts. No N+1.
 *
 * The denormalised fields are READ-OPTIMISED, not stored: they're computed
 * fresh on every SELECT, so a user rename is reflected on next fetch.

 * resolves in practice, but the type stays optional for safety).
